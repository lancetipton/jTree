## Types

### Dynamically Loaded

* Installed as a node_module
* Must follow strict path

    `node_modules/jtree-definitions/build/<name of types js file>`
  * All different types of definitions should follow this pattern
* Current libraries
  * [Javascript](https://github.com/lancetipton/jtree-definitions)

### Priority
  * In matching value to `Type Class Instance` and more then one match is found
    * The `Type Class Instance` with higher priority will be used
    * If the priority is the same
      * If the matches extend the same `Parent Type Class`
        * If `Parent Type Class` has a `matchHelper` method
          * It will be called
        * If `Parent Type Class` does not have a `matchHelper` method
          * The `Base Parent Type Class` `matchHelper` method will be called
